A statistical technique called linear regression is used to establish the linear relationship between the predictor variables and one or more explanatory variables. This technique could be used to address problems involving supervised learning regression in which we attempt to predict a continuous variable.

Simple and Multiple Linear Regression are two more classifications for linear regression. In this case, I have multiple independent variables and one dependent variable, thus we will use simple linear regression and multiple linear regression techniques. It is the most basic type of linear regression in which the data are fitted with a straight line.
